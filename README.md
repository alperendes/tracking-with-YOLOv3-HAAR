# trackingwithYOLOv3andHAAR

The projects point was to detect the fishs movements w.r.t. sinusoidal waves.

I used pandas DataFrame in my main detection codes and in some versions of these codes, I saved those DataFrames as csv files.

'frameExtraction.py' is a code that I used for creating dataset from my videos.

'serialGrapher.py' is a code that I used for plotting every frame from videos with using .csv files.

'trainingYOLOv3.ipynb' is a code to train labeled dataset. All credit about this code, goes to PySource from Youtube.
